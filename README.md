# README for Library Lib66 0.1 2025-01-30

__Lib66__ is a Non/New Session Manager support library based on the code
in the __Seq66__ project, but that is useful in other applications.
It provides more elegant methods in many cases. It is a work in
progress and the precursor to a potential Seq66 version 2.

Support sites (still in progress):

    *   https://ahlstromcj.github.io/
    *   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/ahlstromcj.github.io/wiki

# Major Features

    The "include" directory holds the header files.

    Note that a work.sh script is provided to simplify or clarify various
    operations such as cleaning, building, making a release, and installing
    or uninstalling the library.

##  Library Features

    *   Provides header files common to all "66" library and application
        projects (except Seq66, which does not use Meson).
    *   Can be incorporated into a Meson project as a subproject, 
        or into other git-supported projects as a submodule.

##  Code

    *   The code is all C/C++ header files.

##  Fixes

    *   None
