# README for Library Lib66 1.0 2025-01-31

__Lib66__ is a headers-only support library based on the code
in the other "66" projects, but that is useful in other applications.
It also is meant to be a subproject of the "66" projects.

# Major Features

    The "include" directory holds the header files.

    Note that a work.sh script is provided to simplify or clarify various
    operations such as cleaning, building, making a release, and installing
    or uninstalling the library.

##  Library Features

    *   Provides header files common to all "66" library and application
        projects (except Seq66, which does not use Meson).
    *   Can be incorporated into a Meson project as a subproject, 
        or into other git-supported projects as a submodule.

##  Code

    *   The code is all C/C++ header files.

##  Fixes

    *   None
